My name is Koblížek and I'm young Java developer, interested in bytecode manipulation and Minecraft modding!  
- I have been programming in Java for 4 years, learnt libraries such as:
  - Bukkit, Spring, ASM, FabricMC, Gradle API
- I'm interested in things such as decompilation and deobfuscation of Java applications, I've also attempted to build a Minecraft modloader
- I also know Kotlin(mainly for Gradle API)
- In terms of web development I love to use Typescript with NextJS and React, for styling I obviously love Tailwind!
- You can find some more info on my website: https://koblizek.lol/ altough I haven't updated it in like 2 years.
