## Who am I? ðŸ‘¦
I am a young software developer from Czech Republic, currently studying on High School with
hopes of not being replaced by AI before I graduate from university. I started
coding back when I was 14, and learnt a lot since then.

## What are my skills? ðŸŽˆ
> For me, skills are not "skills", there's always room for improvement, therefore I consider these as something I am comfortable writing.

- **Java** - I have been writing Java for a long time, probably since the start. Wrote plugins with Bukkit, JavaFX, but nowadays use Spring framework the most.
- **Kotlin** - Primarily use for small projects & buildscripts
- **C** - I love digging in low-level projects
- **Js/Ts** - Mostly familiar with Next.js web framework, but always open for new opportunities in web field!

*P.S.: I'm always opened for new job opportunities, if you have an inquiry, feel free to contact me on my email address :)*
